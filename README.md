# Quizzical

This is a Solo Project from Scrimba's React course which uses the OTDB (Open Trivia DB) API to make a fun quiz game. It has taught me all about the basics of react from props, to state, to consuming APIs and more in a lot of detail. One specific issue I had some trouble with was when the API returned the question data but with HTML Entities and figuring out what they are and how to decode them took some time.
